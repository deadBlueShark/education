We've all said we'd go back and clean it up later. We didn't know LeBlanc's law:
`Later equals never`

 The cleanup doesn't have to be something big. Change one variable name for the 
 better, break up one function that's a little too large, eliminate one small 
 bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement.
