## HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
# Suppose you had a collection of shapes and you needed to group
# all of the same shapes together in individual sets.
# Pseudocode:

# for (each shape) {
#   if (shape is ellipse) {
#     ellipses.add(shape)
#   } else if (shape is rectangle) {
#     rectangles.add(shape)
#   } else {
#     triangles.add(shape)
#   }
# }

## ALGORITHM CHARACTERISTICS
# - Algorithm complexity: 
#   + Space complexity: How much memory does it require?
#   + Time complexity: How much time does it take to complete?
# - Input and output
# - Classification: 
#   + Serial/parallel, exact/approximate, deterministic/non-deterministic
