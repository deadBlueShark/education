### What is Solidity?
Solidity is an object-oriented language for writing smart contracts.
Smart contracts are programs stored inside a blockchain, and they specify the rules and behavior for digital assets are transferred. 
You use Solidity to program smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain platform. 
Smart contracts contain state and programmable logic. Transactions result in functions executed in smart contracts. Thus, smart contracts enable you to create a business workflow.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine
Solidity contracts run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM for short. It's a sandboxed environment that is completely isolated. It doesn't access anything else on the network besides the contracts it executes.
