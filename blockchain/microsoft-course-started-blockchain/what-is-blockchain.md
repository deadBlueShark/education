### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a record-keeping and contract-enforcement technology that uses cryptography to make it extremely difficult to change previous history. It allows participants to share workstreams by tracking changes on a shared ledger.

  **1. Centralized database**
There is only one database, all participants are using the same set of data. All participants need to trust the database is correct, and by extension they need to trust the owner of the database not to modify historical data for any reason.

  **2. Distributed database**
Handling failures and conflicts can add complexity and data integrity issues.

  **3. Distributed ledger**
Blockchain technology is referred to as a distributed ledger. Just like an accounting ledger, the distributed ledger is a history of transactions. Each transaction in the ledger affects the final state.
