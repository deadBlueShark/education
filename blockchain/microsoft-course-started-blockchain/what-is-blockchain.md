### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a record-keeping and contract-enforcement technology that uses cryptography to make it extremely difficult to change previous history. It allows participants to share workstreams by tracking changes on a shared ledger.

  **1. Centralized database**
There is only one database, all participants are using the same set of data. All participants need to trust the database is correct, and by extension they need to trust the owner of the database not to modify historical data for any reason.

  **2. Distributed database**
Handling failures and conflicts can add complexity and data integrity issues.

  **3. Distributed ledger**
Blockchain technology is referred to as a distributed ledger. Just like an accounting ledger, the distributed ledger is a history of transactions. Each transaction in the ledger affects the final state.

### How blockchain works?

 **1. How is data distributed?**
Each participant with a blockchain node has a copy of the ledger so that they can do their own auditing and integration with their systems. But, there isn't a requirement for each company to have their own node. Nodes may be shared between partners.

**2. Trusted logic**
A decentralized application (DApp) is an application on a distributed computing system.
Ethereum DApps are called smart contracts. A smart contract contains logic that is executed as part of a transaction. On Ethereum, you program the logic using a programming language called Solidity.
Smart contracts are deployed to the blockchain and are referenced by an address.
Just like data in the blockchain, a smart contract is immutable. Once deployed, the logic cannot be changed. Therefore, you can trust that smart contract logic always executes the same on all nodes. Any code changes require a new smart contract be deployed at a new address.

### Blockchain types
**1.Public**
What if you wanted a network where you trusted no one? Anyone with Internet access can join your blockchain network. No onboarding is required and you don't have to ask an authority for permission.
All transactions in the blockchain are visible by any node on the network.

**2. Private**
What if we had some trust of the participants in the blockchain network? The information stored in the blockchain would only be accessible to participants invited to the blockchain network. Private networks are semi-trusted networks. In a private network, there is an agreement between all participants about how they will leverage the blockchain.

**3. Blockchain protocols**
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Others
