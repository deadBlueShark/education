## Multitasking does not equal productivity
Multitasking and distraction are the enemies of productivity. A lot of peope think that doing tons of things at once is the most productive use of their time. But this logic is dead wrong.

## Strategies for achieving deep work
There are different strategies for achieving deep work, all of which require intention.

**Monastic approach** (monastic: thuộc về tu sĩ, tu viện)

Eliminating all sources of distraction and secluding(to keep someone or something away from other people or things) yourself like a monk

**Bimodal approach**

Which involves setting a clearly defined long period of seclusion for work and leaving the rest of your time free for everything else.

**Rhythmic approach**

The idea here is to form a habit of doing deep work for blocks of say, 90 minutes, then using a calendar to track your accomplishments.

**Journalistic strategy**

Take any unexpected free time in your daily routine to do deep work

*But regardless of which technique you employ, it's key to remember that they're methodical, not random. In fact, that's exactly the difference between being in the zone and deep work. After all, you get in the zone by chance and often only after hours of procrastination. On the other hand, deep work is intentional and desired, which makes it essential to have rituals that prepare your mind for it. One ritual might be to define your space. It can be as simple as placing a "Do not disturb" sign on your office door, or going to a library or coffee shop. The latter is especially helpful if you work in an open office. Just take J.K. Rowling who while finishing her last Harry Potter book stayed at a five star hotel just to escape her hectic home environment and cope with the pressure so she could get into deep work. Another ritual is to define boundaries. For example, by disconnecting the Internet or turning off your phone. And finally, make your deep work sustainable, because whether it's light exercise, food, or a caffeine pick me up, it's essential to give your body what it needs if you want to focus. If you don't, you will never have the mental energy you need to stay in deep work.*

## Productive meditation

Focus your brain and be selective about your use of technology. In the modern world our brains have grown accustomed to craving(thèm muốn) distraction. After all, everywhere we look people are glued to their screens playing games, messaging or refreshing their Facebook pages on repeat. The problem is that our brains are wired to be easily distracted. That's because evolutionarily speaking these distractions could pose risks or opportunities.

As a result, it's hard for us to deeply focus on one task. But don't worry. Productive meditation can rewire your brain and help you focus. Here's how it works. Use moments that would otherwise be unproductive, like walking your dog, taking a shower or commuting to work, to consider a problem you need to take care of without letting your mind change subjects. To get started ask yourself questions that identify different issues in solving a given problem. Then, once you've landed a specific target, ask yourself action questions like, what do I need to accomplish my goal? Think about it like a hardcore workout routine for your brain, that will help build your focus. 

It's also key to be mindful of your intentions when using social media and the Internet. For instance, if you use Facebook to keep in touch with friends, then use it to communicate with them, but also make an effort when possible to spend more time with them in person. And if you can't manage to do that try going cold turkey. Quit social media for 30 days and afterward, ask yourself, would the past month would have been that much better with social media in my life? Did anyone care that I stopped using it? If you answer no to both, give it up for good. But if you answer yes then it's probably for the best to return to it.

## Schedule work and free time

Scheduling both work and free time is essential to restoring energy. When you get home from work or running errands all day often all you want to do is well, nothing. And for lots of us that means, having no fixed time slots where we have to complete tasks. But ironically enough we end up stuck to the same routine every night. We watch TV, scroll through our phones, or stare at our computers, then when it's finally time to go to bed, we feel more tired than when we got home. Leaving us depleted of energy for the next day. How can you avoid that situation? 

By scheduling everything you do you'll free up time for being mindful of how you spend it. At the start of every workday, create a schedule that is divided into blocks of at least 30 minutes. In this schedule you should set both work and personal tasks like time to relax, eat, or catch up on email. It's inevitable that your schedule change during the day. But if this happens just rearrange your blocks. The idea isn't to strictly abide by your itinerary, but to cultivate awareness about how you spend your time. That means it's also key to plan your evenings and weekends ahead so you can take actions toward specific goals. So try to leave your work at the office for instance. By imposing limitations and not checking on our email after a certain time. By doing so you'll give your mind the space it needs to shut down. Finally, planning your evenings and weekends around activities other than those involving the internet, can help you revitalize your mind and body. Maybe it's reading, exercise, or just some quality time with loved ones.
