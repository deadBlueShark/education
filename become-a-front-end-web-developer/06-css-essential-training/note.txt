1) CSS references
style.css
@import url('/style/person.css')
@import url('/style/animal.css')

Uses the @import rule which imports one or more stylesheets into HTML files or
into another CSS file. This method can be used to import all the smaller CSS files
into a single CSS file, which is then loaded into the HTML document between a style
tag in the head of the document. This method isn't used often these days because the
downside to using import is the potential for slowing down your page speed.
Import does not allow for parallel downloads, meaning the page must download an
entire stylesheet before it loads the rest of the page

2) Pixel density
- Refers to the number of pixels within a space
- Measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI)

3) Code styles guideline

4) 5 properties make up box model: width, height, padding, margin, border

The width and height has no effect on inline element, change display property to
block or inline-block

5) Absolute and relative length
em: Represents inherited font-size of parent element
rem: Represents the font-size of the root element

6) The box model

  400 width
+ 30 padding-left
+ 30 padding-right
+ 20 border-left
+ 20 border-right
-------------------
500px total width

Margin does not contribute to the total size of the element but it does effect
the amount of space that the element takes up

Margin collapsing (only affect top and bottom margin)

To remove space (margin) beetween inline element, use negative margin or set font-size
of parent element to 0

7) font-size

em:
- relative unit so it's a size in relation to its closest ancestor element font size
(1em is equal to its inherited font size, if no font size is declared anywhere,
then one em is equal to the default browser font size)
- Changing the font size in the parent or ancestor element will change the value of the child element.

rem: root em
