// Primitives are immutable: there is no way to change a primitive value. 
// Primitives are also compared by value

// Objects are different than primitives. First, they are mutable, their 
// values can change. Objects are not 
// Compared by value: two objects are not equal even if they have the same 
// properties and values. And two arrays are not equal even if they have the 
// same elements in the same order
