// Primitives are immutable: there is no way to change a primitive value. Primitives are also compared by value

// Objects are different than primitives. First, they are mutableâ€”their values can change. Objects are not 
// compared by value: two objects are not equal even if they have the same properties and values. And two 
// arrays are not equal even if they have the same elements in the same order
