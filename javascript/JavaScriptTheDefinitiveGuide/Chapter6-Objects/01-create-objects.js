// Objects can be created with object literals, with the new keyword, and (in ECMAScript 5) with the Object.create()

// literals
var students = { name: 'nguyen', age: 23 };

// new keyword
var scores = new Array();
console.log(scores);

// prototype
// Every JavaScript object has a second JavaScript object (or null, but this is rare) associated with it. This second
// object is known as a prototype, and the first object inherits properties from the prototype.
