1. Overview of the cyber kill chain

Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that was developed by Lockheed Martin
  - A framework of best practices for planning your counter-measures
  - Industry standard among security practitioners

Step of a attack

  - Reconnaissance
    + who and where
    + harvesting emails, social sites ...
  - Weaponization
    + Tool for the attack
  - Delivery (where an attacker will send the Trojan, virus or whatever weapon he's programmed)
    + How and where the bad code will be delivered
    + Email is typically the delivery mechanism
  - Exploitation
    + Exploit the vulnerability found
  - Installation
    + Tool installs what it need to control the system
    + Malware is often used in these cases
    -> This is where a user may have clicked on a link and it'll install itself in
    the background without his knowledge
  - Control
    + The tool takes over part or the entire system
  - Action
    + The hacker now has full control over the resource
    + Typically uses ransom strategies or pulls data

2. Plan an attack strategy

- Reconnaissance: evaluate vulnerabilities of the application's code, DB, access to users
- Weapon/tool:
- Deliver the exploit: send the exploid or upload to the application DB
- Automatic installation
- Control of resources: the tool would probably make some minor changes into the code
without hurting the application at large
- Communication of remedy: report to the client what recommendations, or code, or system
changes needs to be done in order to improve the application's security
