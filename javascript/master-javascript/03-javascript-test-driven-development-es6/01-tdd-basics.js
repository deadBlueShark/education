1. What is TDD?
2. Advantages of TDD
  - TDD forces us to clarify our thinking before writing production code
  - Improves communication between developers
  - Improves the structure of our production code
  - Allow developers to make worry-free changes
3. Disadvantages of TDD
  - TDD takes longer at first
  - TDD isnt always a favorite with management
  - Beware of writing bad tests
4. The basic TDD cycle
  - Write a failing test
  - Write production code to make the test pass
    + The key here is that we are only allowed to write just enough code to make the
      test pass, nothing more -> prevent untested code
    + Do not worry about finding the optimal solution right away.
  - Refactor the code you wrote
    + Find a more efficient solution
    + Clean of code
    + Make code more readable, more modular
5. Writing effective tests
Criteria for a good test:
- Readable
- Isolated
- Thorough
- Explicit
6. The three different types of tests
- Unit test
- Integration test
- End to End test
